# Website Demo
I've created a simple project to show how to work with EasyPersist in the real life.
The website consists of 2 pages and allows you to view the list of cities, add a city and edit a city.

On edit page for Counties I use OpenSource project -- [AJAX facebook like  Autocomplete control](http://convincingmail.com/autosuggest-autocomplete.aspx).

also other opensource used:
[Prototypejs javascript framework](http://www.prototypejs.org)
[AJAX Control Toolkit](http://www.codeplex.com/AtlasControlToolkit)

## How To Run
* Download **Web Site Demo** from the Release Page
* Unzip into IIS folder (usually c:\Inetpub\wwwroot\) The ZIP contains a folder with the site an SQL Struct and SQL Server 2005 DB bak. You need to restore the db backup in you SQL. 
* You can open website with Visual Studio and run it there or From IIS console create an application for the folder with the site files
* Go to _your site root_\App_Code\AppConfig.cs and edit Connection string 
* Open the site in the browser
